#Project Title
Discovering Music Trends with Spotify Data

#Goal
Use the Spotify API to explore music trends over time, understand what makes a song popular, and build a dashboard that helps people explore different genres, decades, or sound profiles.

#Project Description
Instead of predicting hits like most music data projects, I want to dig into what songs are made of. Using the Spotify API, I’ll pull data on thousands of tracks, including audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, and more. Then I’ll look at how these features vary across genres, over time, or based on popularity. I'm hoping to uncover fun or unexpected patterns, like whether songs are getting shorter, which genres are the most energetic, or how music has evolved in the last few decades.

The idea is to make it visual and easy to explore. Something that could be useful for playlist curators, indie artists, marketers, or anyone who’s just into music.

#Deliverables
A cleaned dataset with Spotify audio features and metadata
Visuals that show trends and insights
A regression or classification model to predict something like popularity or genre
A Tableau dashboard that makes it all interactive and easy to explore
